What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git subdirectory is created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory: where you create and modify files until you think that they are worth 'committing'.
Not sure what to say about the staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Use git diff --staged
