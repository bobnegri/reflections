What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git subdirectory is created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory: where you create and modify files until you think that they are worth 'committing'.
Not sure what to say about the staging area.
