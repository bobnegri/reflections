When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When working with others
- When making your work public
- Disaster recovery

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you don't trust one of your team mate's coding ability?
